# 🚀 CreditFlow: Alternative Credit Scoring & Financial Platform

CreditFlow is a modern, full-stack financial application designed to provide alternative credit scoring for individuals (such as gig workers) lacking traditional credit histories. By leveraging users' income, expenses, and platform connections, CreditFlow uses AI to score creditworthiness, recommend micro-insurance, and facilitate emergency loans.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Scope

The application is structured as a robust microservices-inspired monorepo consisting of three distinct modules:

1. **`frontend`** (React, Vite, TailwindCSS)
   - The user-facing application providing interactive dashboards for both Borrowers and Lenders.
2. **`backend`** (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
   - The primary REST API managing users, authentication, financial records, loan applications, and core business logic.
3. **`insurance-ai`** (Python, FastAPI, Groq/LLaMA 3)
   - An intelligent microservice that analyzes user risk profiles to recommend tailored micro-insurance products.
